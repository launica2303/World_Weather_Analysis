# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose:
Using PlanMyTrip app to retrieve Weather Data
Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Create a Travel Itinerary Map

To improve the PlanMyTrip app weather description was added to the weather data. Beta testers can input statements to filter through to find their weather preferences. By doing this they can find travel destinations they would want to travel to and be able to find nearby hotels. 
The app will allow them to pick as many as four travel city destinations to create an itinerary. Using Google Maps Directions API a marker layer map will be created to provide a travel route between the cities and a marker layer map will be displayed.


## Summary: 
The app can be updated to add nearby attractions travelers would want to visit as well as restaurants. Many other destinations that would be appealing to travelers for the specific cities can also be added in if needed. Depending what the weather is for the specific season the locations will vary since some cities will become cold or hot in different seasons.
